 Guide: Manually Bridge X6100 Audio to a Bluetooth Headset 
This guide explains how to run a script on the Xiegu X6100's internal Linux system to send the radio's receive audio to a paired Bluetooth headset. This is based on the work from the Xiegu X6200 Stuff repository by pier-cbd, adapted to work with the X6100. 
How it Works: You will run a command in the radio's terminal that starts an audio pipeline. This terminal session must remain open while you are listening. 

Part 1: One-Time Setup 
You only need to perform these steps once. 
1. Connect to the Radio's Console 
 Connect a USB-C cable from your computer to the DEV port on the X6100. 
 On your computer, open a terminal and connect using 
 Press Enter a few times to see a login prompt. 
 Username: root   Password: 123 

2. Create the Launcher Script 
 From the radio's console, create a new script file: 
 ``` nano /root/start_bt_audio.sh ```

Paste the entire block of code below into the file. This script finds your headset and runs the GStreamer command that we confirmed works. 
```
#!/bin/sh
# Manual script to start the X6100 Bluetooth Audio Bridge.
# This script runs in the foreground. Press Ctrl+C to stop. 
# Find the Bluetooth headset's sink name automatically 
SINK_NAME=$(pactl list short sinks | grep "bluez_sink" | awk '{print $2}') 
# Check if a sink was found 
if [ -z "$SINK_NAME" ]; then 
echo "Error: No Bluetooth headset found. Make sure it's connected." 
exit 1 
fi 
echo "Starting audio bridge to $SINK_NAME..." 
echo "Press Ctrl+C in this terminal to stop." 
# The proven, working GStreamer command for the X6100 
gst-launch-1.0 pulsesrc device=alsa_input.mixcapture ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2,format=S16LE ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! pulsesink device="$SINK_NAME" sync=false buffer-time=80000 latency-time=40000
```

- Save the file and exit by pressing Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X. 
- Make the script executable:
``` chmod +x /root/start_bt_audio.sh ```

3. Create the Easy-to-Use Alias 
- This gives you a simple, one-word command to run your script.
- Open your profile for editing: 
   ```nano /root/.profile ```
 - Add this single line to the file: 
 ```alias btaudio='/root/start_bt_audio.sh' ```
-  Save the file and exit. 

Part 2: Your Daily Workflow 
This is how you will use the system each time. 

1. Turn on your X6100 and your Bluetooth headset. 
2. Use the radio's front-panel menu to ensure the headset is paired and connected. 
3. Connect your PC to the radio's DEV port and log in to the console using the screen command from Part 1. 
4. In the console, type the simple command: 
 ```btaudio ```
5. The audio will start playing in your headset. 
6. Leave this terminal window open on your PC while you are listening. 
7. When you are finished, go back to the terminal window and press Ctrl+C to stop the audio stream.
